A browser-based Integrated Development Environment that spins up isolated coding environments on Kubernetes.
I built this project to dive deep into **Kubernetes internals**, **WebSockets**, and **System Design**.

## System Architecture

### How it works

1.  **Orchestration**: When you initialize a project (e.g., Python or React), the backend uses the Kubernetes `client-go` library to dynamically provision a Pod, Service, and Ingress specifically for that workspace.
2.  **State Management**: The file tree is generated by walking the local directory structure on the backend. This avoided the "impedance mismatch" of trying to store a hierarchical file tree in a key-value store.
3.  **Terminal Streaming**: Fully interactive terminal, connects via WebSocket to the backend, which proxies the stream directly into the K8s pod's shell using SPDY/remotecommand execution.

## Features

* **Multi-Language Support**: Environment setup for Node.js, Python, Go, C++, and React(Vite).
* **Real-time File Explorer**: Create, delete, and update files and folders instantly.
* **Integrated Terminal**: A fully functional `xterm.js` terminal connected to the container's shell.
* **Live Preview**: For React projects, an Ingress is automatically configured to expose the running application on a subdomain (e.g., `workspace-id.127.0.0.1.nip.io`).

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
* **React + TypeScript**: For a robust and type-safe UI.
* **Xterm.js**: For rendering the terminal output in the browser.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.

**Backend**
* **Go (Golang)**: Chosen for its concurrency primitives and excellent Kubernetes support.
* **Gorilla WebSockets**: Handles the persistent connections for file updates and terminal streaming.
* **Kubernetes Client-Go**: Used for programmatic control of the cluster.

**S3**
* **AWS**: For downloading boilerplate template code files.

**CI/CD**
* **Github Actions**: Automatically pushes latest image to github container registry.
